I want you to improve and upgrade my disease detection system in the following ways:

===============================
✅ INPUT HANDLING (STRUCTURED)
===============================
Accept JSON input like this:

{
  "patient_info": {
    "name": "Mrs. Anjali D.",
    "age": 38,
    "gender": "female",
    "existing_conditions": []
  },
  "symptoms": [
    "fatigue", "headache", "dizziness", "palpitations", "cold hands", "brain fog"
  ],
  "lab_results": {
    "Hemoglobin": "10.1 g/dL",
    "Ferritin": "8 ng/mL",
    "TSH": "5.8 uIU/mL",
    "Vitamin D": "18 ng/mL"
  }
}

Parse this input and extract:
- Symptom cluster types (cardio, metabolic, neuro)
- Risk factor detection (age > 45, gender, etc.)
- Rule-based enhancements (see below)

===============================
🧠 DIAGNOSIS AND LOGIC
===============================
Move beyond just listing disease probabilities.

1. Instead, produce a "Most Likely Conditions" section with natural language explanations like:

> Based on the symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and hair thinning, the system strongly suspects **Iron Deficiency Anemia**. This condition is especially common in women aged 30–50. Likelihood: **High**.

Use tiers like:
- Very Likely (80–100%)
- Likely (60–80%)
- Moderate (40–60%)
- Possible (20–40%)
- Unlikely (<20%)

2. Group conditions into:
- Most Likely
- Possibly Present
- Ruled Out

3. Incorporate lab values into reasoning:
- If Hemoglobin < 11 and Ferritin < 15 → anemia becomes “very likely”
- If TSH > 4.5 → boost hypothyroidism
- If Vitamin D < 20 → boost vitamin D deficiency

4. Add rules to detect:
- Anemia (fatigue, hair loss, cold hands, dizziness, low Hb/ferritin)
- Hypothyroidism (fatigue, brain fog, cold intolerance, high TSH)
- Nutritional deficiency (fatigue, memory, low vitamin D)
- Stress (fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, headache)

📄 OUTPUT FORMAT
===============================

Your output should include:

        AI-POWERED HEALTH ASSESSMENT REPORT

Generated on: <timestamp>

PATIENT INFORMATION
--------------------
Age: <age>
Gender: <gender>
Existing Conditions: <list>

SYMPTOMS REPORTED
-----------------
<bullet symptoms>
Severity Level: <score>
Urgency Level: <low/med/high>

MOST LIKELY CONDITION(S)
------------------------
1. Iron Deficiency Anemia
   Likelihood: High
   Why: Fatigue, hair thinning, cold extremities, dizziness
   Confirm With: CBC + Ferritin test

2. Hypothyroidism
   Likelihood: Moderate
   Why: Brain fog, fatigue, high TSH
   Confirm With: TSH + T3/T4 test

Conditions Unlikely:
- Diabetes
- Heart Disease

AI EXPLANATION
--------------
Natural language summary of results, 3–5 sentences

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Schedule CBC & thyroid panel
2. Track symptoms daily
3. Eat iron-rich foods or consider supplements

DISCLAIMER
----------
This tool provides screening insights and should not replace medical evaluation.

===============================
🧰 TECH STACK (RECOMMENDATIONS)
===============================
- Use JSON parsing in backend
- Use Jinja2 templates or Python f-strings for report formatting
- Use rule-based symptom scoring + LLM summary generator (optional)
- Output as markdown, plain text, or PDF

You can break this into steps — just confirm what you need help with next.
